<small class="about-content">Visiting my mother's home in December 2014.</small>

<p class="bio about-content">Writing about yourself is a special type of torture, so why don't you save me the agony and stalk me on <a href="http://www.amirahaile.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a> or <a href="http://www.instagram.com/amirahaile">Instagram</a> instead. If that's not enough for you, you can always break the fourth wall and <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=@amirahaile,%20what's%20up%20girl?">tweet me</a>. (FYI, I also love getting <a href="mailto:amira.dhaile@gmail.com?Subject=Girl,%20we%20should%20know%20each%20other.">email</a> from strangers.)
